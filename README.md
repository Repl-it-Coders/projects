# For Team Members
Hi, thank you for coming here. This repo here is a repo for all the great projects made by the people in this organization. To run the programs and see the projects, do these things. This tutorial for seeing the project will continuously update with the different types of projects.
1. First, clone this repo on your device using the ```git clone https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders/projects```. Make sure you have git installed for this. Another way to do this is using the GitHub CLI. Type ```gh repo clone Repl-it-Coders/projects``` to clone this project using the command line if you have GitHub CLI.
2. Then, go into this repo on your device using ```cd projects``` in your command line.
3. Go into the folder in which the project you want to view is stored, and then, go into the projects file.
### If Python File
4. If the file is a python file(make sure you have python 3 installed), run it using ```python3 filename.py``` in the command line. Replace filename with the name of the file you want to run. Make sure you are in the correct folder before running that command.
#### More options coming soon later.
